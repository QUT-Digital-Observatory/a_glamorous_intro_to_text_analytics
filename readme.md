# A Glamorous Introduction to Text Analytics

In this two-part workshop series, you will learn to collect posts from Reddit - using the very sparkly example of the Eurovision Song Contest - and apply a range of text analytic techniques to them. Some experience with R coding preferred, no experience with social media data collection or text analysis required.
